        <h4>Why Programming:</h4>
        <p>I have always had a passion of technology and data. I began teaching myself a bit of Python, and quickly realized that this was something I wanted to pursue further. The draw to Data Engineering is the ability to empower me to pursue my passion of data, and pivot my career towards a more technical path.</p>
